# EVIDA — Project Memory & Implementation Ledger

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Phase 1 — EVIDA Core Backend / Investigation Lifecycle
- **Status:** COMPLETED
- **Last Updated:** 2026-10-27

---

## Current Objective
Phase 1 core investigation lifecycle foundation is fully implemented and verified. Standing by for Phase 2 (Repository Ingestion & Failure Reproduction).

---

## Completed

### Phase 0 — Foundation
- [x] Initialized Git repository with clean `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, `.env.example`, and `LICENSE` (MIT).
- [x] Authored core architecture docs: `PRD.md`, `Architecture.md`, `Rules.md`, `Phases.md`, `Design.md`, and `docs/` (`DATABASE.md`, `API.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`).
- [x] Implemented Next.js App Router frontend (`apps/web`) with visual design, `/` landing page, `/health`, `/login`, and `/dashboard`.
- [x] Implemented FastAPI backend (`apps/api`) with Pydantic v2, structured logging, credential scrubbing, standardized error envelopes, `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/health/ready` endpoints.
- [x] Implemented AI provider abstraction (`apps/api/app/ai/`) with `NebiusAIProvider`, `MockAIProvider`, and configurable NVIDIA open model (`NEBIUS_MODEL`).
- [x] Implemented isolated sandbox runner (`sandbox/runner/runner.py`) with hard timeouts, memory limit policies, and controlled execution.
- [x] Authored Supabase initial schema migration (`supabase/migrations/20261027000000_initial_schema.sql`) and `seed.sql` with UUID keys, updated_at triggers, and strict RLS tenant isolation.

### Phase 1 — Core Lifecycle & State Machine
- [x] **State Machine (`apps/api/app/domain/investigations/state_machine.py`):** Canonical transitions (`CREATED` -> `INGESTING` -> `REPRODUCING` -> `INVESTIGATING` -> `VERIFYING` -> `COMPLETED`, terminal `FAILED`).
- [x] **Transition Validation & Error Codes:** Deterministic error envelopes with codes `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`, `INVESTIGATION_ALREADY_TERMINAL`, `INVESTIGATION_NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_INVESTIGATION_REQUEST`, `INVESTIGATION_PERSISTENCE_ERROR`.
- [x] **Idempotent Start Endpoint (`POST /api/v1/investigations/{id}/start`):** Begins lifecycle; repeated calls safely return current state without re-triggering transitions or corrupting state.
- [x] **Investigation CRUD:** Creation (`POST /api/v1/investigations`), retrieval (`GET /api/v1/investigations/{id}`), and tenant listing (`GET /api/v1/investigations`).
- [x] **Chronological Event Timeline (`GET /api/v1/investigations/{id}/events`):** Ordered event history emitted on creation and state transitions.
- [x] **Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20261027010000_investigation_events.sql`):** Added `investigation_events` table with index `(investigation_id, created_at ASC)` and RLS policies; updated `investigations` status constraints.
- [x] **Persistence Abstraction:** Protocol-based repository with transaction-consistent in-memory storage for offline development/testing and Supabase integration.
- [x] **Automated Validation:** 57 backend tests passing, frontend tests passing, Ruff lint/format clean, Mypy strict type checking clean.

## Next Steps
- Await instruction to start **Phase 2 — Repository Ingestion & Failure Reproduction**.
- Do not begin Phase 2 until instructed.

## Known Issues & Notes
- Live Nebius API calls require an active `NEBIUS_API_KEY`; unit tests use `MockAIProvider` for 100% offline test reliability.
- Live Supabase operations require an active instance; schema migrations are packaged in standard SQL with Supabase CLI configuration.
